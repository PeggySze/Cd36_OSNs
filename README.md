### Summary
By analyzing single-cell multi-omics data of mature OSNs in the mouse olfactory epithelium, we systematically revealed the transcriptome diversity and spatial distribution of Cd36+ OSNs and found a specific subset of olfactory receptors co-expressed with Cd 36 in a deterministic manner, and identified and confirmed Tshz1 as a critical transcription factor that directly promotes Cd36 expression in OSNs through enhancer binding.

### Data
- Data is available on the NCBI GEO at Accession number GSE224604.
